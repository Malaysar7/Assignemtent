    "Q1.  What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and structure software in a way that models real-world entities, concepts, and interactions as objects. OOP aims to provide a clear and organized approach to software development by emphasizing the following key principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on that data into a single unit called an object. This helps in hiding the internal complexities of an object and exposing only the necessary interfaces, enhancing modularity and reducing potential conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on simplifying complex reality by modeling classes that represent essential properties and behaviors of objects. It allows developers to create a simplified representation of real-world entities and interactions, making it easier to manage and understand the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. This promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization of classes, allowing developers to build upon existing structures without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This concept enables the use of a single interface to represent various implementations, promoting flexibility, extensibility, and the ability to write more generic and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary goal of OOP is to facilitate the design, implementation, maintenance, and evolution of software systems by promoting modularity, reusability, and a better understanding of the problem domain. It encourages a more natural and intuitive way of thinking about software development by mimicking the relationships and interactions observed in the real world"

    "Q2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a specific instance of a data structure or a user-defined class. Everything in Python is an object, including simple data types like integers and strings, as well as more complex data structures and user-defined classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object in Python has both data (attributes) and methods (functions) associated with it. The data represents the state of the object, and the methods define its behaviors or actions. Objects can interact with each other by invoking methods or accessing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a simple Python class representing a Car\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",

    "Attributes:\n",
    "Attributes are variables that hold data, representing the characteristics or properties of an object. They define the state of an object. Attributes are defined within the class and are shared among all instances of that class. Each instance can have different values for these attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Class Variables:\n",
    "Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any instance methods.\n",

    "Changes to a class variable will affect all instances of the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, the self parameter in class methods is used to refer to the instance of the class that the method is being called on. It is a convention, not a keyword, but it's commonly used and understood by Python programmers. The self parameter allows you to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of the current instance within the class methods.\n",

    "When you create an instance of a class and call its methods, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method. By convention, this first parameter is named self in most Python code (though you can technically name it whatever you want).
